# One-Time-Pad-Python-Practice

This is my attempt to code something like a one-time pad encryption.

I am trying to refine skills in python and actually learn the workflow with GitHub and I am very new to this.

My idea was to make two seperate codes one for encryption then decryption, then interweave the automation components to make these a runable script in bash. These are my goals for now, but I will adjust as I learn more.
