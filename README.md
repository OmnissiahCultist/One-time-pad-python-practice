### One-Time-Pad-Python-Practice

- This is my attempt to code a one-time pad encryption and kind of a self journal to reflect on.

- I am trying to refine skills in python and actually learn the workflow with GitHub and I am very new to this. I understand the concept of not reinventing the wheel for encryption, but I enjoy the practice and learning about how encryption works.

- My idea was to make two seperate codes one for encryption then decryption, then interweave the automation components to make these a runable script in bash. These are my goals for now, but I will adjust as I learn more.

- Branch conflicts are scary

# [ Jan. 16, 2025]

- Using ChatGPT to output a OTP and look at my code helped me learn a bit and find ways to optimize or better write my own code. So I will be restarting. I still need to look at other examplesof the one time pad code made in python to verify ChatGPT's version.

- I just now learned that python has a XOR operator built in with ^ and that OTP is more commonly assocaited with One Time Password.

- ChatGPT also pointed out that my earlier code used 7-bit encoding instead of what is supposed to be 8 for the full ASCII characters. ChatGPT also suggested that the cyphertext should be hex, I don't know how the encryption process is effected by the output being hex vs ASCII but I will look into that as I start the next attempt.
